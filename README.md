# Frogger-like Arcade Game

## Instructions for Play

Avoid the killer ladybugs! The princess must use the **up, down, left, and right** arrow keys to escape to the water on the other side.

Each time she successfully crosses all three rows of stone, where the ladybugs are marching to destroy her, a win is added to the "Wins" count on screen.

She must be careful! The game provides the princess with three lives to start. Life count will decrease each time the princess and a ladybug collide. Once life count reaches zero, the game resets, and the win count goes back to 0.

Game is playable on [GitHub Pages](https://smckinney1.github.io/FroggerClone/).
